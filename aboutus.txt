It was developed by Riddhish V. Lichade as a project in Computer Science for class XII.

Python is used as the programming language and MySQL as the back-end programme.
The code uses python libraries like tkinter, mysql.connector and datetime.

We have tried our best to make the program easy to use, attractive and 
user friendly.

The safety of transactions has also been taken into consideration.

We hope you loved this project and visit us again :)
